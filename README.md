# 3D
a repository of 3D printing files that might be useful to microscopists

1) Adaptors for measuring the laser power of the Zeiss Z.1 lightsheet microscope using a Thorlabs S170C sensor. The "LS_Z.1_sensor_holder_for_ThorLabs_S170C" holds the sensor, the "ThorLabs_S170C_dummy" can be printed in phosphorescent PLA to record the location of where the laser beam hits the sensor

2) The "Slide_for_13mm_round_coverslip" is the base for a quick and dirty way of creating a single-well chambered slide by mounting a 13mm diameter round coverlip on the microscopy slide (glue, nail polish)

3) The "Grabber_small_Z.1_adaptor_for_agarose_blocks" is the base for constructing a miniature claw adaptor for the Z.1 - grabbing small agarose blocks for lightsheet microscopy (SPIM) - additional parts (e.g. a hollowed out screw, a nut, the inner workings of a bead grabber) have to be acquired separately
